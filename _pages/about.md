I am a Ph.D. student at the National University of Singapore in the School of Computing. At the same time, I am a full-time researcher at A\*STAR Bioinformatics Institute in Computer Vision and Pattern Discovery for Bioimages Group.


RESEARCH INTERESTS
---
I am interested in developing *(i) novel machine learning models* and *(ii) machine learning-based information systems for digital histopathology and integrative multi-omics* to support diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making in cancer. Currently, I focus on the intersection of digital histopathology and genomics in cancer research. Specifically, my current research is to develop novel machine learning models that predict genomics features from digital histopathology images.
